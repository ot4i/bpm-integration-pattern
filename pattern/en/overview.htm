        <p>You can use this pattern to integrate an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) integration service with 
        an IBM Integration Bus service.</p>

        <p>You can use this pattern to generate a new IBM Integration Bus service that can be called 
        by IBM Business Process Manager.
		</p>
		<p>Before using this pattern, read the information about IBM Business Process Manager in the IBM Integration Bus 
		information center; see

<p>The BPM and IBM Integration Bus developers work together to integrate an IBM BPM integration service with 
an IBM Integration Bus service, by completing the following steps:</p> 
<p>First, the BPM developer must complete the following tasks:
</p><ol>
<li>Using a BPM toolkit, create or identify the BPM integration service that needs to call the IBM Integration Bus service.</li>
<li>Create a BPM export (<span class="filepath">.twx</span> file) that contains 
one or more integration services with input and output variables defined.</li></ol>
<p>Next, the IBM Integration Bus developer must complete the following tasks:
</p><ol>
<li>Generate a new pattern instance by selecting the required BPM integration service from 
the <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file.
<p>
The generated IBM Integration Bus service contains a service interface 
(WSDL file) that has an operation with inputs and outputs that correspond to the 
BPM integration service definition.
</p></li>
<li>Develop the IBM Integration Bus service, deploy the service to an integration node (broker), and verify that the service works correctly.</li>
<li>Export the service as a new <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file.</li>
<p>The new <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file contains details of the new service in the form of an 
implementation of a BPM Web Service integration that includes the service URL and appropriate business object mapping.</p>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the BPM developer must complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the BPM toolkit that was used to create the BPM integration service, import the 
new <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file.</li>
<p>The BPM integration service is updated with the details of the IBM Integration Bus service. The 
BPM integration service can now call the IBM Integration Bus service.
</p></ol>
