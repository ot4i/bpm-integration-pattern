	<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the <span>Data distribution SAP to WebSphere MQ: 
	one-way (for IDoc)</span> pattern</h1>
	<div>
		<p class="shortdesc">
		A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
		<p class="shortdesc">
		You can use the <span>Data distribution SAP to WebSphere MQ: one-way (for IDoc)</span> pattern only 
		if you meet all of the following constraints:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are receiving IDocs from SAP by using the WebSphere Adapter for SAP, this pattern is not 
			applicable for BAPIs.</li>
			<li>You are using WebSphere MQ queues to communicate between the Data distribution SAP to 
			WebSphere MQ: one-way (for IDoc) flow and the flows that are processing the IDocs. Currently 
			only the MQInput node supports IDoc parsing.</li>
			<li>If you choose to enable logging in the pattern, the log messages are sent to a queue. 
			The processing of these log messages is outside the scope of this pattern and you must process 
			the logging messages in the way that is most appropriate for your organization. When logging is 
			selected, log messages are written to the logging queue as persistent messages, which affects 
			performance. Persistent messages are used because it is assumed that logging is being used for 
			audit purposes. If logging is for test or information only, logging can be switched off in 
			production systems by configuring the user-defined property (UDP): <span class="msobjprop">LogginOn</span>.</li>
			<li>If you choose to enable error messages in the pattern, error messages are sent to a queue 
			when an exception occurs. Monitoring errors, and taking corrective action, is outside of the scope 
			of the pattern, and you must process the error messages in the way most appropriate for your 
			organization.</li>
			<li>The pattern defines its own format for the logging and error messages and it is assumed that 
			these are sufficient to meet the requirements in your own environment.</li>
		</ul>
