	<div class="p">
		<p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, you must determine 
		which of the following tasks are required.  If required, complete the following tasks: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>
		  Select a unique name for the pattern instance. You can use the pattern multiple times and create 
		  multiple different instances, which can be distinguished by their unique names. 
		  Identify the purpose of the pattern instance, so that you can decide on an appropriate or meaningful 
		  unique name. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  Identify any queue managers and queues that are required for this pattern and decide on the unique 
		  names that you want to use. Take into account any policies, standards, or naming conventions 
		  that must apply. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  Decide whether you require logging of messages. If logging is required, you must decide to 
		  which queue manager and queue the logging messages are sent. You can send logging messages 
		  to a general logging queue that is used by multiple message flows, or you can use a queue 
		  created specifically for the pattern instance. </li>
		  <li>
		  Decide if you want to produce error messages for the pattern instance. If this pattern instance 
		  handles updates, use error handling to ensure that you do not lose any data. 
		  You can send error messages to a general error queue that is used by multiple message flows, 
		  or you can use a queue created specifically for the pattern instance. 
		  If you choose to send error messages in the pattern instance, you can turn this function on or 
		  off by configuring the broker archive (BAR) file before deployment. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  Gather the details of your SAP system including: Host name, remote function call (RFC) program ID, 
		  Gateway host, Gateway service, Client number, and System number.
		  </li>
		</ul>
